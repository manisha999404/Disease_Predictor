After you digest these foods, they enter your bloodstream, are carried to your lungs and affect your breath. Tobacco products. Smoking causes unpleasant mouth odor. Tobacco users also are more likely to have gum disease, which is another source of bad breath. Not keeping your mouth and teeth clean. If you don't brush and floss daily, food particles remain in your mouth, causing bad breath. A colorless, sticky film of bacteria called plaque forms on your teeth. If not brushed away, plaque can irritate your gums. Eventually, it can form plaque-filled pockets between your teeth and gums. The early stage of gum disease is known as gingivitis. Late-stage gum disease with bone loss is called periodontitis. Your tongue also can trap bacteria that produce odors. Dentures also can collect odor-causing bacteria and food particles, as can fixed or removable oral appliances such as braces that aren't cleaned regularly or don't fit properly. Dry mouth. Saliva helps cleanse your mouth, removing particles that cause bad odors. A condition called dry mouth or xerostomia (zeer-o-STOE-me-uh) can be a part of bad breath because you produce less saliva. Dry mouth naturally occurs during sleep, leading to ""morning breath."" It gets worse if you sleep with your mouth open. Constant dry mouth can be caused by a problem with the glands that produce saliva and by some diseases. Medicines. Some medicines can lead to bad breath by causing dry mouth. The body breaks down other medicines and releases chemicals that can be carried on your breath. Infections in your mouth. Surgical wounds after mouth surgery, such as tooth removal, as well as tooth decay, gum disease or mouth sores, can cause bad breath. Other mouth, nose and throat conditions. Small stones that form in the tonsils, called tonsil stones or tonsilloliths, are covered with bacteria that can cause bad breath. Infections, or constant swelling in the nose, sinuses or throat, can lead to postnasal drip. This is when fluid from your nose runs down the back of your throat. This condition also can cause bad breath. Other causes. Diseases such as some cancers can cause a distinctive breath odor. The same is true for disorders related to the body's process of breaking food down into energy. Constant heartburn, which is a symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD, can lead to bad breath. A foreign body, such as a piece of food lodged in a nostril, can cause bad breath in young children."

B,Blood in urine (hematuria),https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/blood-in-urine/symptoms-causes/syc-20353432,"Urinary tract infections (UTIs). These happen when bacteria get into the tube through which urine leaves the body, called the urethra. Then the bacteria multiply in the bladder. UTIs can cause bleeding that makes urine look red, pink or brown. With a UTI , you also may have a strong urge to pee that lasts a long time. You may have pain and burning while peeing. Your urine may have a very strong smell too. Kidney infection. This type of UTI also is called pyelonephritis . Kidney infections can happen when bacteria enter the kidneys from the bloodstream. Infections also can happen when bacteria move to the kidneys from a pair of tubes that connect the kidneys with the bladder, called the ureters. Kidney infections can cause the same urine-related symptoms that other UTIs can. But they're more likely to cause a fever and pain in the back, side or groin. A bladder or kidney stone. The minerals in urine can form crystals on the walls of the kidneys or bladder. Over time, the crystals can become small, hard stones. The stones are often painless. But they can hurt a lot if they cause a blockage or leave the body through urine. Bladder or kidney stones can cause blood in urine that can be seen with the naked eye as well as bleeding that can be seen only in the lab. Enlarged prostate. The prostate gland is just below the bladder, and it surrounds the top part of the urethra. It often gets bigger toward middle age. It then puts pressure on the urethra, partly blocking the flow of urine. With an enlarged prostate, you might have trouble peeing, an urgent or lasting need to pee, or blood in the urine. Infection of the prostate, called prostatitis, can cause the same symptoms. Kidney disease. Blood in urine that can be seen only in the lab is a common symptom of a kidney disease called glomerulonephritis. With this disease, the tiny filters in the kidneys that remove waste from blood become inflamed. Glomerulonephritis may be part of a condition that affects the whole body, such as diabetes. Or it can happen on its own. Cancer. Blood in urine that can be seen with the naked eye may be a sign of advanced kidney, bladder or prostate cancer. These cancers might not cause symptoms sooner, when treatments could work better. Inherited illnesses. A genetic condition that affects red blood cells, called sickle cell anemia, can cause blood in urine. The blood cells could be visible or too tiny to see. A condition that damages tiny blood vessels in the kidneys, called Alport syndrome, also can cause blood in the urine. Kidney injury. A blow or other injury to the kidneys from an accident or contact sports can cause blood to show up in urine. Medicines . The anti-cancer drug cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) and the antibiotic penicillin are linked to blood in urine. Medicines that prevent blood clots also are tied to blood in urine. These include medicines that keep blood cells called platelets from sticking together, such as the pain reliever aspirin. Medicines that thin the blood, such as heparin, also may be a cause. Hard exercise. Blood in the urine can happen after playing contact sports, such as football. It may be linked to bladder damage caused by getting hit.

J,Jaw tumors and cysts,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/jaw-tumors-cysts/symptoms-causes/syc-20350973,"Ameloblastoma. This rare, usually noncancerous (benign) tumor begins in the cells that form the protective enamel lining on the teeth. It develops most often in the jaw near the molars. The most common type is aggressive, forming large tumors and growing into the jawbone. Although this tumor can recur after treatment, aggressive surgical treatment will typically reduce the chance of recurrence. Central giant cell granuloma. Central giant cell granulomas are benign lesions that grow from bone cells. They most often occur in the front portion of the lower jaw. One type of these tumors can grow rapidly, cause pain and destroy bone, and has a tendency to recur after surgical treatment. The other type is less aggressive and may not have symptoms. Rarely, a tumor may shrink or resolve on its own, but typically these tumors require surgical treatment. Dentigerous cyst. This cyst originates from tissue that surrounds a tooth before it erupts into the mouth. This is the most common form of cyst that affects the jaws. Most often these cysts will occur around wisdom teeth that are not fully erupted, but they can also involve other teeth. Odontogenic keratocyst. This cyst is also referred to as a keratocystic odontogenic tumor because of its tumorlike tendency to recur after surgical treatment. Although this cyst is typically slow growing, it can still be destructive to the jaw and teeth if left untreated over a long period of time. Most often the cyst develops in the lower jaw near the third molars. These cysts may also be found in people with an inherited condition called nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. Odontogenic myxoma. This is a rare, slow-growing, benign tumor that occurs most often in the lower jaw. The tumor can be large and aggressively invade the jaw and surrounding tissue and displace teeth.

M,Movement disorders,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/movement-disorders/symptoms-causes/syc-20363893,"Ataxia. Ataxia affects the part of the brain that controls coordinated movement. Ataxia may cause clumsy movements of the arms and legs, and a loss of balance. Ataxia also can change a person's speech and cause other symptoms. There are many causes of ataxia, including genetic and degenerative conditions. Ataxia also may be caused by an infection or another treatable condition. Chorea. Chorea causes brief, irregular, somewhat rapid, involuntary movements that happen over and over. The movements typically involve the face, mouth, trunk, arm and leg. Chorea can look like exaggerated fidgeting. The most common genetic chorea is Huntington's disease. This disease is passed down from a parent and gets worse over time. It can be confirmed with genetic testing. Huntington's disease has three types of symptoms. They include movements that can't be controlled, trouble with thinking and mental health conditions. Dystonia. This condition involves involuntary muscle contractions that cause twisting, irregular postures, or movements that occur again and again. Dystonia may affect the entire body or one part of the body. The most common type of dystonia in adults is cervical dystonia. In cervical dystonia, the neck muscles contract involuntarily. This causes the head to pull to one side or to tilt forward or backward. The head also may shake, known as a tremor. Functional movement disorder. This condition may look like any of the movement disorders. But it's not caused by a disease of the nervous system, also known as a neurological disease. Functional movement disorders are treatable. Multiple system atrophy. This rare condition affects many brain systems and gets worse over time. Multiple system atrophy causes a movement disorder, such as ataxia or parkinsonism. It also can cause low blood pressure, bladder symptoms and acting out dreams. Myoclonus. Myoclonus are very quick jerks of a muscle. Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease causes tremors, muscle stiffness, slow or decreased movement, or loss of balance. It also can cause symptoms not related to movement. These symptoms include a reduced sense of smell, constipation, acting out dreams and a decline in thinking skills. Parkinson's disease slowly gets worse over time. Parkinsonism. Parkinsonism is a general term for slowness of movement along with stiffness, tremors or loss of balance. There are many different causes. Parkinson's disease and certain dopamine blocking medicines are the most common causes. Other causes include degenerative disorders such as multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy. Stroke or repeated head trauma also can cause parkinsonism. Progressive supranuclear palsy. This is a rare nervous system condition that causes problems with walking, balance and eye movements. It may resemble Parkinson's disease but is a distinct condition. Restless legs syndrome. This movement disorder causes aching, itching, or creeping feelings in the legs while relaxing or lying down. The feeling often goes away with movement. Tardive dyskinesia. This neurological condition is caused by long-term use of certain medicines used to treat mental health conditions, called neuroleptic medicines. It also can be caused by a common gastrointestinal medicine called metoclopramide (Reglan, Gimoti). Tardive dyskinesia causes involuntary movements that occur over and over. Symptoms include grimacing, eye blinking and other movements. Tourette syndrome. This is a neurological condition associated with repetitive movements and vocal sounds called tics. Tics are voluntary movements, but they're caused by an involuntary urge to make the movements. Tourette syndrome starts between childhood and teenage years. Tremor. This movement disorder causes rhythmic shaking of parts of the body, such as the hands, head or other body parts. The most common type is essential tremor."

N,Narcolepsy,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcolepsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20375497,"Extreme daytime sleepiness. Daytime sleepiness is the first symptom to appear, and the sleepiness makes it hard to focus and function. People with narcolepsy feel less alert and focused during the day. They also fall asleep without warning. Sleep can happen anywhere and at any time. It may happen when they are bored or while doing a task. For example, people with narcolepsy can suddenly fall asleep while working or talking with friends. It can be especially dangerous to fall asleep while driving. Sleep may last only a few minutes or up to a half-hour. After waking, people with narcolepsy feel refreshed but get sleepy again. Automatic behaviors. Some people with narcolepsy continue doing a task when they fall asleep briefly. For example, they may fall asleep while writing, typing or driving. They might continue to perform that task while asleep. After waking, they can't remember what they did, and they probably didn't do it well. Sudden loss of muscle tone. This condition is called cataplexy. It can cause slurred speech or complete weakness of most muscles for up to a few minutes. It's triggered by intense emotions — often positive emotions. Laughter or excitement may cause sudden muscle weakness. But sometimes fear, surprise or anger can cause the loss of muscle tone. For example, when you laugh, your head may drop without your control. Or your knees may suddenly lose strength, causing you to fall. Some people with narcolepsy experience only one or two episodes of cataplexy a year. Others have several episodes a day. Not everyone with narcolepsy has these symptoms. Sleep paralysis. People with narcolepsy may experience sleep paralysis. During sleep paralysis, the person can't move or speak while falling asleep or upon waking. The paralysis is usually brief — lasting a few seconds or minutes. But it can be scary. You may be aware of it happening and can recall it afterward. Not everyone with sleep paralysis has narcolepsy. Hallucinations. Sometimes people see things that aren't there during sleep paralysis. Hallucinations also may happen in bed without sleep paralysis. These are called hypnagogic hallucinations if they happen as you fall asleep. They're called hypnopompic hallucinations if they happen upon waking. For example, the person might think they see a stranger in the bedroom who isn't there. These hallucinations may be vivid and frightening because you may not be fully asleep when you begin dreaming. Changes in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. REM sleep is when most dreaming happens. Typically, people enter REM sleep 60 to 90 minutes after falling asleep. But people with narcolepsy often move more quickly to REM sleep. They tend to enter REM sleep within 15 minutes of falling asleep. REM sleep also can happen at any time of the day."

After childhood, new spots stop appearing. Freckling in the armpits or groin area. Freckling often appears by ages 3 to 5. Freckles are smaller than cafe au lait spots and tend to occur in clusters in skin folds. Tiny bumps on the iris of the eye, known as Lisch nodules. These nodules can't easily be seen and don't affect vision. Soft, pea-sized bumps on or under the skin called neurofibromas. These benign tumors usually grow in or under the skin but can also grow inside the body. A growth that involves many nerves is called a plexiform neurofibroma. Plexiform neurofibromas, when located on the face, can cause disfigurement. Neurofibromas may increase in number with age. Bone changes. Changes in bone development and low bone mineral density can cause bones to form in an irregular way. People with NF1 may have a curved spine, known as scoliosis, or a bowed lower leg. Tumor on the nerve that connects the eye to the brain, called an optic pathway glioma. This tumor usually appears by age 3. The tumor rarely appears in late childhood and among teenagers, and almost never in adults. Learning disabilities. It's common for children with NF1 to have some trouble with learning. Often there is a specific learning disability, such as trouble with reading or math. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and speech delay also are common. Larger than average head size. Children with NF1 tend to have a larger than average head size due to increased brain volume. Short stature. Children who have NF1 often are below average in height."

P,Perimenopause,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/perimenopause/symptoms-causes/syc-20354666,"Irregular periods. As ovulation becomes more unpredictable, the time between periods may be longer or shorter, your flow may be light to heavy, and you may skip some periods. If the length of your periods is consistently different by seven days or more, you may be in early perimenopause. If you go 60 days or more between periods, you're likely in late perimenopause. If you go 12 months without a period and then start bleeding, talk to your healthcare professional right away. This could be a sign of a health issue. Hot flashes. Many people have hot flashes during perimenopause. Hot flashes can vary in how strong they are, how long they last and how often they happen. Sleep problems. Trouble sleeping is often due to hot flashes or night sweats, but not always. Changes in sleep patterns can happen in perimenopause even without hot flashes or night sweats. Mood changes. Mood swings, irritability or increased risk of depression may happen during perimenopause. Mood changes can happen for other reasons that are not related to perimenopause. For example, people with a history of hormonal mood changes such as premenstrual syndrome, premenstrual dysmorphic disorder or postpartum depression are more likely to have mood changes during perimenopause. People who have had mood disorders in the past, such as depression or anxiety, are also at risk. Vaginal and bladder problems. As estrogen levels drop, your vaginal tissues may become drier and less elastic, causing pain during sex. This dryness also can cause burning when you urinate, even if you do not have a urinary tract infection. It also can make you more likely to have urinary or vaginal infections. And you might leak urine more often, need to go more frequently or feel a stronger urge to go. Decreasing fertility. As ovulation becomes less regular, it's harder to get pregnant. However, if you're having periods, pregnancy is still possible. If you don't want to get pregnant, use birth control until you've gone 12 months without a period. Changes in sexual function. During perimenopause, sexual arousal and desire may change. Some women may not enjoy sex as much, while others enjoy it more. If you are concerned about your sexual health during or after perimenopause, talk to your healthcare professional. Loss of bone. As estrogen levels lower, you start to lose bone more quickly than you replace it. This increases your risk of a disease that causes fragile bones, called osteoporosis. People with osteoporosis are at risk of bone breaks. Changing cholesterol levels. Less estrogen may lead to changes in your blood cholesterol levels. This can include an increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, also called the ""bad"" cholesterol, which increases the risk of heart disease. At the same time, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, also called the ""good"" cholesterol, decreases in many women as they age. Together, these changes increase the risk of heart disease."

S,Schizophrenia,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/schizophrenia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354443,"Delusions. This is when people believe in things that aren't real or true. For example, people with schizophrenia could think that they're being harmed or harassed when they aren't. They could think that they're the target for certain gestures or comments when they aren't. They may think they're very famous or have great ability when that's not the case. Or they could feel that a major disaster is about to occur when that's not true. Most people with schizophrenia have delusions. Hallucinations. These usually involve seeing or hearing things that other people don't observe. For people with schizophrenia, these things seem real. Hallucinations can occur with any of the senses, but hearing voices is most common. Disorganized speech and thinking. Disorganized speech causes disorganized thinking. It can be hard for people with schizophrenia to talk with other people. The answers people with schizophrenia give to questions may not be related to what's being asked. Or questions may not be answered fully. Rarely, speech may include putting together unrelated words in a way that can't be understood. Sometimes this is called word salad. Extremely disorganized or unusual motor behavior. This may show in several ways, from childlike silliness to being agitated for no reason. Behavior isn't focused on a goal, so it's hard to do tasks. People with schizophrenia may not want to follow instructions. They may move in ways that are not typical or not appropriate to the social setting. Or they may not move much or respond at all. Negative symptoms. People with schizophrenia may not be able to function in the way they could before their illness started. For example, they may not bathe, make eye contact or show emotions. They may speak in a monotone voice and not be able to feel pleasure. Also, they may lose interest in everyday activities, socially withdraw and have a hard time planning ahead."

Having an artificial joint. Bacteria can be introduced during joint replacement surgery, or an artificial joint may become infected if germs travel to the joint from a different area of the body through the bloodstream. Taking medications for rheumatoid arthritis. People with rheumatoid arthritis have a further increase in risk because of medications they take that can suppress the immune system, making infections more likely to occur. Diagnosing septic arthritis in people with rheumatoid arthritis is difficult because many of the signs and symptoms are similar. Skin fragility. Skin that breaks easily and heals poorly can give bacteria access to your body. Skin conditions such as psoriasis and eczema increase your risk of septic arthritis, as do infected skin wounds. People who regularly inject drugs also have a higher risk of infection at the site of injection. Weak immune system. People with a weak immune system are at greater risk of septic arthritis.

Typical red blood cells usually live for about 120 days before they need to be replaced. But sickle cells usually die in 10 to 20 days, leaving a shortage of red blood cells. This is known as anemia. Without enough red blood cells, the body can't get enough oxygen. This causes fatigue. Episodes of pain. Periodic episodes of extreme pain, called pain crises, are a major symptom of sickle cell anemia. Pain develops when sickle-shaped red blood cells block blood flow through tiny blood vessels to the chest, abdomen and joints. The pain varies in intensity and can last for a few hours to a few days. Some people have only a few pain crises a year. Others have a dozen or more a year. A severe pain crisis requires a hospital stay. Some people with sickle cell anemia also have chronic pain from bone and joint damage, ulcers, and other causes. Swelling of hands and feet. Sickle-shaped red blood cells block blood circulation in the hands and feet, which can cause them to swell. Frequent infections. The spleen is important for protecting against infections. Sickle cells can damage the spleen, raising the risk of developing infections. Babies and children with sickle cell anemia commonly receive vaccinations and antibiotics to prevent potentially life-threatening infections, such as pneumonia. Delayed growth or puberty. Red blood cells provide the body with the oxygen and nutrients needed for growth. A shortage of healthy red blood cells can slow growth in babies and children and delay puberty in teenagers. Vision problems. Tiny blood vessels that supply blood to the eyes can become plugged with sickle cells. This can damage the portion of the eye that processes visual images, called the retina, and lead to vision problems."
