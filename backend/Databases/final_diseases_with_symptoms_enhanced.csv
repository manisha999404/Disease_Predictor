It begins when fats, cholesterols and other substances gather along the walls of your arteries. This process is called atherosclerosis. It's typically no cause for concern. However, too much buildup can lead to a blockage, obstructing blood flow.

Second, men are generally at a greater risk. But the risk for women increases after menopause. Existing health conditions matter, too. High blood pressure can thicken your arteries, narrowing your blood flow. High cholesterol levels can increase the rate of plaque buildup. Diabetes is also associated with higher risk, as is being overweight. Your lifestyle plays a large role as well. Physical inactivity, long periods of unrelieved stress in your life, an unhealthy diet and smoking can all increase your risk. And finally, family history.

Although this tumor can recur after treatment, aggressive surgical treatment will typically reduce the chance of recurrence.', 'Central giant cell granuloma.Central giant cell granulomas are benign lesions that grow from bone cells. They most often occur in the front portion of the lower jaw. One type of these tumors can grow rapidly, cause pain and destroy bone, and has a tendency to recur after surgical treatment.

Rarely, a tumor may shrink or resolve on its own, but typically these tumors require surgical treatment.', 'Dentigerous cyst.This cyst originates from tissue that surrounds a tooth before it erupts into the mouth.

Although this cyst is typically slow growing, it can still be destructive to the jaw and teeth if left untreated over a long period of time. Most often the cyst develops in the lower jaw near the third molars. These cysts may also be found in people with an inherited condition called nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome.', 'Odontogenic myxoma.This is a rare, slow-growing, benign tumor that occurs most often in the lower jaw. The tumor can be large and aggressively invade the jaw and surrounding tissue and displace teeth. Odontogenic myxomas are known to recur after surgical treatment; however, the chances of tumor recurrence are typically lessened by more-aggressive forms of surgical treatment.', 'Odontoma.This benign tumor is the most common odontogenic tumor. Odontomas often have no symptoms, but they may interfere with tooth development or eruption. Odontomas are made up of dental tissue that grows around a tooth in the jaw. They can resemble an oddly shaped tooth or can be a small or large calcified tumor. These tumors may be part of some genetic syndromes.', 'Other types of cysts and tumors.These include adenomatoid odontogenic tumor, calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor, glandular odontogenic cyst, squamous odontogenic tumor, calcifying odontogenic cyst, cementoblastoma, aneurysmal bone cyst, ossifying fibroma, osteoblastoma. central odontogenic fibroma and others.', ""If you're concerned that you may have symptoms of a jaw tumor or cyst, talk with your primary care provider or dentist."", 'Many times, jaw cysts and tumors do not have symptoms and are typically discovered on routine screening X-rays done for other reasons.
